## What is it?

Euron Coding Agent is an autonomous coding agent with the brain in Python and a
thin front-end. It plans, reads your code, edits files, runs commands, searches
the web, reviews diffs, and coordinates teams of sub-agents - with your approval
at every step. It runs three ways:

- **CLI** - `pip install euron-coding-agent` then `euron-agent`
- **VS Code extension** (and any Open VSX editor: Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf)
- **Self-hosted server** - `euron-agent serve --host 0.0.0.0` with bearer auth

It is not locked to any provider. Bring your own key for any model, or run fully
local with Ollama or LM Studio.

## Highlights

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Agentic loop | plan, read, edit, run, verify, with native tool-calling |
| Any model | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, Cerebras, DeepSeek, Together, Mistral, xAI, Vercel AI Gateway, Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible API |
| Multi-agent teams | a coordinator delegates subtasks to specialists; state persists |
| Scheduled agents | run tasks on cron (`schedule create --cron "0 9 * * MON-FRI"`) |
| MCP, plugins, skills | unlimited tool and capability extensibility |
| Rules, memory, commands | `AGENTS.md`, `.euron/skills`, `.euron/commands` |
| Approvals and permissions | allow/ask/deny rules, diffs, undo, cancel |
| Notifications | Slack, Discord, Telegram, Google Chat, WhatsApp, Linear |
| Multimodal | attach images to vision models |
| Web | `web_search` and `web_fetch` |
| Headless | `run --json` for CI/CD and scripting |
| Self-host / cloud | bind any host, bearer-token auth |

## Works with every model

Not locked to one provider. Built-in profiles (just pick one and add a key):

| Provider | Example models | Key env |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Claude Opus / Sonnet / Haiku | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | GPT series | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | Gemini series (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | 200+ models from any provider | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Groq / Cerebras | fast inference (Llama, etc.) | `GROQ_API_KEY` / `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek / Together / Mistral / xAI | their hosted models | `*_API_KEY` |
| Vercel AI Gateway | models via the gateway | `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` |
| Euron / Euri | Euron-hosted models | `EURI_API_KEY` |
| Ollama / LM Studio | local models, no key | - |
| Custom | any OpenAI-compatible / self-hosted (incl. AWS Bedrock, Azure, GCP Vertex via a proxy) | configurable |

Capabilities (vision, tools, thinking) degrade gracefully when a model lacks them.

## Installation

### CLI (pip)

```bash
pip install euron-coding-agent          # add "[anthropic]" for native Claude, "[mcp]" for MCP
euron-agent                             # interactive chat in the current folder
euron-agent update                      # update to the latest version anytime
```

Recommended (isolated, avoids dependency/locking issues, especially on Windows):

```bash
python -m venv euron-env
# Windows: euron-env\Scripts\activate    |  macOS/Linux: source euron-env/bin/activate
pip install euron-coding-agent
euron-agent
```

You never need to configure model-specific quirks - the client auto-adapts to
each provider's API (for example, models that require `max_completion_tokens`
instead of `max_tokens`, or that reject a custom temperature, are handled
automatically).

Set a provider and key right inside the chat - no files needed:

```
you: /provider openai      # or gemini, anthropic, groq, ollama, ...
you: /key                  # paste your API key (stored in ~/.euron-agent)
you: create a FastAPI hello-world app with a test
```

### VS Code extension

Install "Euron Coding Agent" from the Marketplace (or Open VSX for
Cursor/VSCodium/Windsurf). On first run it auto-installs its Python backend
(needs Python 3.9+). Click the robot icon, pick a provider (server icon), paste a
key (key icon), and start chatting. Diffs, approvals, plan mode, and image attach
are all in the panel.

Requires Python 3.9+ on your machine for the managed backend.

---

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash
euron-agent                                   # chat (remembers provider/key)
euron-agent run "add a /health route" -y      # one-shot, auto-approve
euron-agent run "summarize the repo" --json    # headless JSON for CI/scripts
euron-agent --team-name auth-sprint "Plan and implement auth with tests"
euron-agent schedule create "PR summary" --cron "0 9 * * MON-FRI" \
    --prompt "List open PRs and their review status" --workspace .
euron-agent schedule daemon                   # fire due schedules
euron-agent serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000  # self-host (prints a bearer token)
```

In-chat slash commands: `/provider /key /model /effort /plan /review /compact
/init /skills /search /usage /undo /reset /yes /help /exit` - plus any custom
command you drop in `.euron/commands/`.

## Features in depth

### Agentic loop and tools
Native tool-calling loop. 28 tools: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`,
`multi_edit`, `create_file`, `delete_file`, `glob`, `search_text`, `run_command`
(streaming output), background processes (`bash_background`/`process_*`),
`git_status`/`git_diff`/`git_commit`/`git_branch`/`git_push`/`open_pr`, git
worktrees (`worktree_add/list/remove`), `web_search`, `web_fetch`, plus meta tools
`todo_write`, `spawn_agent`, `update_plan`, `use_skill`. All workspace-sandboxed.

### Plan mode
Research read-only, propose a plan, you approve, then it executes (`/plan` or the
extension toggle).

### Multi-agent teams
A coordinator breaks work into subtasks and delegates to specialist sub-agents
(own context/tools). Team state persists across sessions:
```bash
euron-agent --team-name auth-sprint "Plan and implement user authentication"
euron-agent --team-name auth-sprint        # resume later
euron-agent team                           # list teams
```

### Scheduled agents
Cron-driven automations that survive restarts (daily PR summaries, weekly
dependency checks, health reports):
```bash
euron-agent schedule create "deps" --cron "0 8 * * MON" --prompt "Check for outdated deps" --workspace /repo
euron-agent schedule list
euron-agent schedule daemon       # run the scheduler (independent of any chat)
```

### Notifications
Push results to Slack, Discord, Telegram, Google Chat, WhatsApp (Twilio), or
Linear (`notifications:` in config) - useful with scheduled and headless runs.

### MCP, plugins, skills, rules, commands - make it your own
- **MCP servers** - connect any Model Context Protocol server; tools appear as
  `mcp__server__tool`. Config under `mcp.servers`.
- **Plugins** - install bundles of skills + commands + MCP from a folder or
  `.zip`: `euron-agent plugin add <dir|url>`.
- **Skills** - `.euron/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (loaded on demand via `use_skill`).
- **Rules / memory** - `AGENTS.md` (or `EURON.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) auto-loaded into context.
- **Custom commands** - `.euron/commands/<name>.md` with `$ARGUMENTS` becomes `/name`.
- **Hooks** - run shell commands on PreToolUse (blocking) / PostToolUse / Stop.
- **Permissions** - `allow`/`ask`/`deny` by tool + glob, with an Always option.

### Safety and control
Approval and diffs on every mutation/command, per-turn checkpoints and undo,
cancel/stop, `.gitignore`-aware ignores, `.env` never read, command timeouts,
sandboxed paths, and bearer-token auth for remote serving.

### Context and cost
`@file` mentions, automatic compaction and `/compact` summarization, token and
cost tracking, extended thinking / reasoning effort presets.

## Configuration

Three layers (later wins): built-in provider profiles, then `config.yaml`, then
`~/.euron-agent/config.json` (set via `/provider`, `/key`), then CLI flags.

```bash
euron-agent init        # scaffold config.yaml + .env (optional - chat works without)
```

See [backend/config.example.yaml](backend/config.example.yaml) for every option:
providers, agent knobs (max_steps, thinking, fallback_models, ...), permissions,
hooks, mcp.servers, web, and notifications.

User data lives in `~/.euron-agent/`: config.json (provider/keys), sessions/
(history), permissions.json, plugins/, skills/, commands/, schedules.json.

## What is included vs. not

Included (parity with, or beyond, Claude Code / Cursor / Cline): agentic loop,
multi-file edits, plan mode, multi-agent teams, scheduled agents, MCP, plugins,
skills, rules/memory, custom commands, hooks, permissions, approvals + diffs,
checkpoints/undo, cancel, named sessions (resume/dashboard/search), web
search/fetch, multimodal images, cost/usage, thinking/effort, git + CI/PR tools,
worktree isolation, code review, notifications (Slack/Discord/Telegram/Google
Chat/WhatsApp/Linear), headless JSON, self-host + auth, every model.

Intentionally not included (different product surface, or would break
model-agnosticism):

- Cursor Tab (proprietary inline-completion model)
- A hosted cloud service with managed background agents or mobile apps
- A managed PR-review SaaS (we ship the local `/review` equivalent)
- Computer-use GUI control and browser automation
- Vector-DB / embeddings indexing (we use ripgrep + agentic search, like Claude Code)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design and
[PROJECT_GUIDE.md](PROJECT_GUIDE.md) for a file-by-file tour.

## Self-hosting / cloud

```bash
euron-agent serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000     # prints a bearer token
# point the extension at it: euronAgent.serverUrl = ws://HOST:8000/ws ; euronAgent.token = <token>
```
REST `POST /agent/run` (with `Authorization: Bearer ...`) for CI/CD. WebSocket
`/ws` for streaming + approvals.

## Develop and test

```bash
cd backend && pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest -v     # 60 tests
cd extension && npm install && npm run esbuild && npx vsce package
```

## Publishing (maintainers)

Tag a release and CI publishes everything; see [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md) and
`.github/workflows/`.
```bash
git tag v1.0.2 && git push origin v1.0.2     # PyPI + Marketplace + Open VSX
```

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The agent is built to be extended - add a tool in
`backend/euron_agent/tools.py`, a provider in `config.py`, or a skill/plugin with
no code at all. Run `pytest` before submitting.
